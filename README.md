## NZHeraldScraper

The NZ Herald needs to do a better job with their whole 'Premium Subscription' thing. As the full article is still within the page's HTML this tool can be used to extract the full article and save it as a .txt in a nice and easy to read format, effectively bypassing the need to subscribe to read the premium articles.

**NOTE**: This is for educational purposes only, you probably shouldn't be bypassing pay walls XD
